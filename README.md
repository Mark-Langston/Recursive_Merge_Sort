# Recursive Merge Sorter

This project implements a recursive merge sort algorithm in C++. It sorts an array of integers and checks if the array is sorted in a non-strictly increasing order before and after sorting.

## Features

- **Recursive Merge Sort**: Efficiently sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.
- **Random Array Generation**: Generates a random array of integers.
- **Order Checking**: Checks if the array is sorted in a non-strictly increasing order before and after sorting.

## Usage

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o RecursiveMergeSort RecursiveMergeSort.cpp
./RecursiveMergeSort
